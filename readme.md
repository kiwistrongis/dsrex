### Dependencies
This code is written in rust, a relatively new language. To compile, you'll need both the `cargo` and `rust` packages. On Archlinux, these are available in the standard repositories and can be installed with a quick `sudo pacman -Syu rust cargo`. On other platforms installation methods may vary.

At the time of writing, the cargo and rust package versions are as follows:

```
community/cargo 0.8.0-1
    Rust package manager

community/rust 1:1.6.0-1
    Systems programming language focused on safety, speed and concurrency
```
